# SAM-M8Q 
This code uses the lwgps library to parse data from the SAM-M8Q GPS chip. The lla is printed to serial. Made for use and test with the Satfab OBC 
The dummy data is included for testing without the GPS module present. 
TODO: alot, but experiementing with how to send/store lla data and time data would be a useful first step
